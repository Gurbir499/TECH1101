<p>A skill is the ability to carry out a task with determined results often within a given amount of time, energy, or both.<br>
     Skills can often be divided into domain-general and domain-specific skills. For example, in the domain of work, some general<br>
      skills would include time management, teamwork and leadership, self-motivation and others, whereas domain-specific skills would be used only for a certain job.<br>
       Skill usually requires certain environmental stimuli and situations to assess the level of skill being shown and used.</p>
